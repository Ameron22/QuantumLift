# Database Migration 45 → 46

## Overview
This migration adds soreness assessment functionality to the GymTracker app while preserving all existing data.

## Changes Made

### New Tables Added
1. **`soreness_assessments`** - Stores user soreness feedback
   - Links to workout sessions and exercises
   - Stores 24hr and 48hr soreness ratings
   - Includes context data (sleep, stress, activity)

2. **`workout_context`** - Stores workout context for ML training
   - Volume, intensity, and recovery factors
   - Days since last workout for each muscle group
   - All data needed for ML model training

### Migration Process
- **Preserves all existing data** (exercises, workouts, sessions, achievements, etc.)
- **Creates new tables** with proper schema
- **No data loss** - all current workout history remains intact
- **Backwards compatible** - existing functionality unchanged

## Testing
The migration includes automated testing to verify:
- ✅ Existing data is preserved
- ✅ New tables are created correctly
- ✅ New tables accept data inserts
- ✅ All database operations work normally

## What Happens When You Run the App
1. **First launch after update**: Migration runs automatically
2. **Existing data**: All your workouts, exercises, and history remain
3. **New functionality**: Soreness assessment system becomes available
4. **Future workouts**: Will automatically schedule soreness assessments

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
- The app will fall back to destructive migration (data reset)
- This preserves app stability but loses data
- **Recommendation**: Test on a backup/development environment first

## Logs to Watch
Look for these log messages:
```
AppDatabase: Migration 45->46 completed: Added soreness assessment tables
MigrationTestHelper: Migration test PASSED - All data preserved and new tables working
```

## Data Verification
After migration, you should see:
- Same number of exercises and workouts as before
- New soreness assessment tables created (initially empty)
- All existing functionality working normally
- New soreness assessment notifications after completing workouts

## Technical Details
- **Migration class**: `MIGRATION_45_46`
- **New DAO**: `SorenessDao` with CRUD operations
- **Testing**: `MigrationTestHelper` verifies migration success
- **Fallback**: Destructive migration if migration fails

## Next Steps
After successful migration:
1. Complete a workout to test soreness assessment scheduling
2. Check notifications appear 24hrs after workout
3. Verify soreness assessment UI works correctly
4. Monitor logs for any issues
